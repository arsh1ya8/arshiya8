## Hi, I’m Arshiya 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate focused on **applied machine learning and data analysis**, with an interest in understanding how models behave on real-world data.

### 🔬 Current Focus
- Applied Machine Learning on tabular data
- Model evaluation & decision trade-offs
- Imbalanced datasets and real-world constraints

### 📌 Featured Project
**UPI Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**  
- 1D CNN for fraud detection on transaction data  
- Focus on precision, recall, and false-negative reduction  
- End-to-end system with data preprocessing and evaluation  

👉 Repo: https://github.com/arshiya8/upi-fraud-detection-ml

### 🛠 Tools & Skills
- Python, NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- Linux, Git  

### 🎯 Goal
To gain research experience in **machine learning**, particularly in model understanding, evaluation, and applied ML systems.
